poc on running code blocks in notes:
============================================================

`markdown-code-runner` can be used to execute arbitrary code blocks using a couple extra steps.
First, we use a `filename` directive in the language specification of the code block, giving a unique filename to associate with the block.
This file will be written relative to `$PYTHONPATH`, and will persist in the filesystem.
If the file exists, it will be overwritten.

```racket markdown-code-runner filename=notes/poc/ex_01.rkt
(write "Hello world from racket!")
```

Then, we write another code block, this time using bash to call the necessary compiler or interpretor.
For this racket example, we'll use the `racket` interpretor to run the file capture it's output.
This bash script is usually not relevant to the document content, and can be written using the hidden style of executable code block supported by `markdown-code-runner`.
Finally, we tell `markdown-code-runner` where to place the bash script's output with the `OUTPUT:START` & `OUTPUT:END` comments seen at the end of the below example.

<!-- CODE:SKIP -->
````
```markdown
<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- cd notes/poc -->
<!-- file=ex_01.rkt -->
<!-- tmp="tmp_$file" -->
<!-- echo "#lang racket" | cat - $file > $tmp && mv $tmp $file -->
<!-- racket $file -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
This will be replaced by stdout from running script, e.g.:
```
Hello world from racket!
```
<!-- OUTPUT:END -->
```
````

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- cd notes/poc -->
<!-- file=ex_01.rkt -->
<!-- tmp="tmp_$file" -->
<!-- echo "#lang racket" | cat - $file > $tmp && mv $tmp $file -->
<!-- racket $file -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

After running `markdown-code-runner <path to this file>`, we should see something like this where we placed the `OUTPUT` comments:

<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```
"Hello world from racket!"```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->
